# TuteDudeAssignment4


Overview : 
This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python.
It includes two tasks that show how to read from a file, write data to a file, append data, and handle errors gracefully.


Task 1 : focuses on reading the contents of a text file named sample.txt and displaying its contents line by line.

 Functionality :

-> Opens the file sample.txt in read mode.
-> Prints a heading: "Reading file content:"
-> Reads the file line by line.
-> Displays each line with a line number.
-> Handles errors if the file does not exist.


 Concepts Used :

-> File opening and reading
-> Looping through file content
-> Exception handling (FileNotFoundError)

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
🔹 Description

Task 2 : demonstrates how to write user input to a file, append additional data, and then read and display the final content of the file named output.txt.

 Functionality :

1.Writing Data 

-> Takes user input.
-> Writes the input to output.txt.
-> Displays a confirmation message after writing.

2.Appending Data

-> Takes additional user input.
-> Appends it to the same file without removing existing content.
-> Displays a confirmation message after appending.

3️.Reading Final Content

-> Reads the complete content of output.txt.
-> Displays all lines on the screen.

 Concepts Used :

-> Writing to a file (write mode)
-> Appending to a file (append mode)
